GGJ 15 Entry

Also (and probably now chiefly) known as Drunkey Kong.

2-4 players use joysticks to move the limbs of a very drunk monkey as they try to guide the inebriated primate to safety.

Controllers required. Flick the joystick to apply force to a hand or foot, and grip objects using the shoulder button. Two players can share a controller for maximum discomfort and entertainment.
